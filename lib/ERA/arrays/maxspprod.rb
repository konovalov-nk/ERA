    # You are given an array A containing N integers. The special product
    #   of each ith integer in this array is defined as the product
    #   of the following:
    #
    #   LeftSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j
    #     such that A[j]>A[i] (i>j). If multiple A[j]â€™s are present in
    #     multiple positions, the LeftSpecialValue is the maximum value of j.
    #
    #   RightSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j
    #     such that A[j]>A[i] (j>i). If multiple A[j]s are present in
    #     multiple positions, the RightSpecialValue is the minimum value of j.
    #
    #   Write a program to find the maximum special product of any
    #     integer in the array.
    #
    #   Input: You will receive array of integers as argument to function.
    #   Return: Maximum special product of any integer in the
    #     array modulo 1000000007.
    #
    #   Note: If j does not exist, the LeftSpecialValue and RightSpecialValue
    #     are considered to be 0.
    #
    #   Constraints 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
    #
    # For example:
    #   A : [3, 6, 8, 9, 2, 4]
    #   Output : 15
